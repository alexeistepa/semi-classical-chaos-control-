Some notebooks from past projects:

FindUpo - An ipython widget that is designed to estimate the location of unstable periodic orbits in chaotic systems using the reccurence principle and machine learning clustering algorithms.

Bifurcation diagrams - notebook that generates nice bifurcation diagrams (it works best with lots of data generated over multiple hours).
