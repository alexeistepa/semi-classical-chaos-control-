**FindUpo** - An ipython widget that is designed to estimate the location of unstable periodic orbits in chaotic systems using the reccurence principle and machine learning clustering algorithms. Guide: https://github.com/alexeistepa/semi-classical-chaos-control-/blob/master/findUPO/FindUPO/FindUPO%20Guide.ipynb

**Bifurcation diagrams** - notebook that generates nice bifurcation diagrams using python package datashader (it works best with lots of data generated over multiple hours). Example of output: https://github.com/alexeistepa/semi-classical-chaos-control-/blob/master/Bifurcation%20Diagrams/Bifurcation%20diagrams/fullbifurcy_wide.png

**fSRK** Efficient Fortran 2nd Order Weak Stochastic Runge-Kutta algorithm for simulating SDEs. Designed to be imported into python as a package. At the minute equations must be edited with the Fortran code.

**Past Projects** (Temporary) Past Projects in Chaos Theory

**Recent Work** (Temporary) Recent work in Quantum Feedback (WIP)
